# Area-Calculator
A simple area calculator with a simple counting feature

When you run the main class, your currently logged in user will be greeted and the current date and time will be displayed.

You will then be asked which 2 values you would like to calculate an area from.
After you have entered both values, it outputs the area.

Then i just let it count from 1-10 to test it and added that you can choose whether it should count forwards or backwards from 1-10.
